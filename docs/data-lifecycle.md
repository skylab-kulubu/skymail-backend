# Template and mailing-list lifecycle

SkyMail retains durable templates, internal mailing lists and historical mail
delivery records. Operator-facing delete commands archive these records; they do
not physically remove them.

## API contract

- `DELETE /v1/templates/{id}` archives a template and returns `204`. Repeating
  the command for the same template is safe and leaves the original archive
  time and actor unchanged.
- `POST /v1/templates/{id}/restore` restores a template and returns the
  restored record. Repeating the command is safe.
- `DELETE /v1/mailing_lists/{id}` and
  `POST /v1/mailing_lists/{id}/restore` provide the same lifecycle for an
  internal mailing list. Keycloak groups are read-only list sources and are not
  archived by these routes.
- Normal item reads, updates, recipient reads and list queries exclude archived
  records. Management list queries accept `lifecycle=current|inactive|all`;
  the default is `current`.
- Restore commands use the existing template/list write permission. A database
  uniqueness conflict is returned as `409 Conflict`; archived records do not
  release an existing unique key for reuse.

Archive metadata is recorded as `archived_at` and `archived_by`. The actor is
the authenticated Keycloak subject when available.

## Mail template versions

From the release that adds `template_versions`, every write through the API
that changes what a version holds — the subject, a source, which source is
main, the rendered HTML or plain text — records a Mail template version, and
versions are never deleted. A write that changes none of these (a repeated
seed, an identical save, a rename) records none. The migration gives every
template that exists then one published first version from its row.

The template row is a copy of the published version, and
`published_version_id` names it. Archiving and restoring a template changes
only the row; its versions stay readable through
`GET /v1/templates/{id}/versions` whether it is archived or not.

During the deploy, the migration runs before the new binary takes over, and
the old binary keeps writing rows without versions in between. A template
written in that window has no version for that write: its row, which is what
is sent, differs from the version marked current until the template's next
write, which records the row as it then is.

## Required variables

A template's Required variables are the variables its HTML body must keep
referencing because the mail cannot do its job without them. They are kept on
the template row, not on its versions, so every version — a restored one
included — is checked against the sets the template has now. Both are served
with every template and kept sorted by name, byte by byte:

- `contract_required_variables` — `[{"name", "reason"}]`, the sending service's
  contract, declared in skymail-frontend beside the Template key and written
  only by the Template seed through `PUT /v1/templates/by-key/{key}`
  (`contract_required_variables`: entries, or names alone with a null reason;
  left out, the set stays as it is; `[]` clears it). The panel cannot change it.
- `operator_required_variables` — names operators mark and release:
  - `POST /v1/templates/{id}/required-variables` with `{"name"}` marks one the
    published body references. A name the contract holds changes nothing.
  - `DELETE /v1/templates/{id}/required-variables/{name}` releases one. A
    contract name is refused with `409 template.required_variable_in_contract`;
    a name that is not required changes nothing.

  Both need `skymail:templates:write`, answer with the template, record no
  version and leave `updated_at` alone. An archived template is `404`.

The two sets never share a name; a name the contract comes to declare leaves
the operators' set.

Every write of a subject and a body — the old panel's `POST /v1/templates` and
`PATCH /v1/templates/{id}`, the seed's upsert, and marking a variable — is
checked inside its transaction, and a refused write leaves neither row nor
version behind:

- `422 template.unparseable`, `params: {"part": "subject"|"html", "error"}` —
  the mailer could not parse it, so it could not be sent at all.
- `422 template.required_variables_missing`, `params: {"missing": [{"name",
  "source": "contract"|"operator", "reason"}]}` — the body no longer references
  these Required variables. A reference is a field of the mailer's data used
  in an action: inside an `if` it counts; in a comment, an HTML comment, plain
  text, a `range` or `with` element's field, or `index . "X"` it does not
  (`internal/mailer/variables.go`, and the cases in
  `internal/mailer/testdata/referenced-variables.json`, which skymail-frontend
  holds a copy of).

## Personal data

Three kinds of field keep an operator's Keycloak subject with no end date:
`mail_tasks.sent_by` (who sent), `archived_by` on templates and mailing lists
(who archived), and `template_versions.author_sub` with `author_name` (who
wrote a version, and the name their token carried then).

SkyMail has no erasure or anonymisation path for account deletion: nothing
tells it an account was deleted, and nothing clears or replaces these fields.
This is a known gap, shared by all three, against ADR-0042's rule that PII is
erased on account deletion rather than kept.

## Retention boundaries

Archiving a template or list preserves `mail_tasks`, `mail_queue`, and mailing
list recipient associations. Historical task reads continue to show the source
template/list name. Archived templates and lists cannot be used to create new
mail tasks.

Removing one recipient from a mailing list remains a physical deletion of the
`mailing_list_recipients` relationship row. Queue residue and other transient
worker data remain outside this durable-record lifecycle.
