# Template and mailing-list lifecycle

SkyMail retains durable templates, internal mailing lists and historical mail
delivery records. Operator-facing delete commands archive these records; they do
not physically remove them.

## API contract

- `DELETE /v1/templates/{id}` archives a template and returns `204`. Repeating
  the command for the same template is safe and leaves the original archive
  time and actor unchanged.
- `POST /v1/templates/{id}/restore` restores a template and returns the
  restored record. Repeating the command is safe.
- `DELETE /v1/mailing_lists/{id}` and
  `POST /v1/mailing_lists/{id}/restore` provide the same lifecycle for an
  internal mailing list. Keycloak groups are read-only list sources and are not
  archived by these routes.
- Normal item reads, updates, recipient reads and list queries exclude archived
  records. Management list queries accept `lifecycle=current|inactive|all`;
  the default is `current`.
- Restore commands use the existing template/list write permission. A database
  uniqueness conflict is returned as `409 Conflict`; archived records do not
  release an existing unique key for reuse.

Archive metadata is recorded as `archived_at` and `archived_by`. The actor is
the authenticated Keycloak subject when available.

## Mail template versions

From the release that adds `template_versions`, every write through the API
that changes what a version holds — the subject, a source, which source is
main, the rendered HTML or plain text — records a Mail template version, and
versions are never deleted. A write that changes none of these (a repeated
seed, an identical save, a rename) records none. The migration gives every
template that exists then one published first version from its row.

The template row is a copy of the published version, and
`published_version_id` names it. Archiving and restoring a template changes
only the row; its versions stay readable through
`GET /v1/templates/{id}/versions` whether it is archived or not.

Drafts are versions too. Saving a draft
(`POST /v1/templates/{id}/drafts`) and restoring a version
(`POST /v1/templates/{id}/versions/{versionId}/restore`) each record a new,
unpublished version; publishing one
(`POST /v1/templates/{id}/versions/{versionId}/publish`) marks it published
and copies it onto the row. An operator's newest version of a template, while
unpublished, is their draft in progress; their earlier drafts stay in the
history, superseded, and so does a draft nobody publishes. Nothing discards a
draft. They are not the ephemeral "expired drafts" ADR-0042 has hard-deleted:
a Mail template draft is part of the template's history (ADR-0046), and no
version is deleted. Like any other update, saving, restoring or publishing a
version of an archived template answers `404` until the template is
un-archived with `POST /v1/templates/{id}/restore`.

During the deploy, the migration runs before the new binary takes over, and
the old binary keeps writing rows without versions in between. A template
written in that window has no version for that write: its row, which is what
is sent, differs from the version marked current until the template's next
write, which records the row as it then is.

## Personal data

Three kinds of field keep an operator's Keycloak subject with no end date:
`mail_tasks.sent_by` (who sent), `archived_by` on templates and mailing lists
(who archived), and `template_versions.author_sub` with `author_name` (who
wrote a version, and the name their token carried then).

SkyMail has no erasure or anonymisation path for account deletion: nothing
tells it an account was deleted, and nothing clears or replaces these fields.
This is a known gap, shared by all three, against ADR-0042's rule that PII is
erased on account deletion rather than kept.

## Retention boundaries

Archiving a template or list preserves `mail_tasks`, `mail_queue`, and mailing
list recipient associations. Historical task reads continue to show the source
template/list name. Archived templates and lists cannot be used to create new
mail tasks.

Removing one recipient from a mailing list remains a physical deletion of the
`mailing_list_recipients` relationship row. Queue residue and other transient
worker data remain outside this durable-record lifecycle.
