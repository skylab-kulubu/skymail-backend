# Template and mailing-list lifecycle

SkyMail retains durable templates, internal mailing lists and historical mail
delivery records. Operator-facing delete commands archive these records; they do
not physically remove them.

## API contract

- `DELETE /v1/templates/{id}` archives a template and returns `204`. Repeating
  the command for the same template is safe and leaves the original archive
  time and actor unchanged.
- `POST /v1/templates/{id}/restore` restores a template and returns the
  restored record. Repeating the command is safe.
- `DELETE /v1/mailing_lists/{id}` and
  `POST /v1/mailing_lists/{id}/restore` provide the same lifecycle for an
  internal mailing list. Keycloak groups are read-only list sources and are not
  archived by these routes.
- Normal item reads, updates, recipient reads and list queries exclude archived
  records. Management list queries accept `lifecycle=current|inactive|all`;
  the default is `current`.
- Restore commands use the existing template/list write permission. A database
  uniqueness conflict is returned as `409 Conflict`; archived records do not
  release an existing unique key for reuse.

Archive metadata is recorded as `archived_at` and `archived_by`. The actor is
the authenticated Keycloak subject when available.

## Retention boundaries

Archiving a template or list preserves `mail_tasks`, `mail_queue`, and mailing
list recipient associations. Historical task reads continue to show the source
template/list name. Archived templates and lists cannot be used to create new
mail tasks.

Removing one recipient from a mailing list remains a physical deletion of the
`mailing_list_recipients` relationship row. Queue residue and other transient
worker data remain outside this durable-record lifecycle.
